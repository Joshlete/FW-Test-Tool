TODO:
Dune:
* highlight multiple telemetry and save them all using a test step number.
* make step number more user friendly, potentially add sub steps.
* create a ssh command sending implementation.
* when UI has multiple segments, combine them all into one file, so there isn't A, B, C.
* make sure saves aren't overriding other files.
* when viewing ui, implement a way to move the screen from GUI.
* add feature with file list that shows all jsons, and copy to clipboard specific color/colors.
* see if it is possible to load up the app fast as a base, then slowly load in the background. It takes a while to start up.

Trillium
* make ews password input dynamic, allow input on GUI.

Both:
* create a general layout, then have objects fill those layouts. possibly have those objects in different files for organization.
