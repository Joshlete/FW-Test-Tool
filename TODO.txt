TODO:
Dune:
* highlight multiple telemetry and save them all using a test step number.
* make step number more user friendly, potentially add sub steps. could just do the _1, _2, _3, etc. So only one button is needed.
* when UI has multiple segments, combine them all into one file, so there isn't A, B, C. Could be same as above.
* make sure saves aren't overriding other files.
* when viewing ui, implement a way to move the screen from GUI.
* add feature with file list that shows all jsons, and copy to clipboard specific color/colors.
* see if it is possible to load up the app fast as a base, then slowly load in the background. It takes a while to start up.
* figure out why the program freezes when viewing ui and printer turns off or connection is lost.
* add CMY ews button, possibly supply setting too? and to UI capture

Trillium

Both:
* add a .log file that logs all messages to the console or message box.
* put back the screen capture saves to file.
* add a message to disconnect from tab printer when trying to change IP.
* figure out why directory goes back to last test when program is force closed.
* for cdm, update yellow color for partial files saved.
